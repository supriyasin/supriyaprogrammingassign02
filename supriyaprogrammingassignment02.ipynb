    "   Understanding the Logic Behind the Conversion of Kilometre to Miles\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Let's begin with the basics; first, we will discuss the measuring units. As we know, \n",
    "   Kilometre and Miles represent the unit of length.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    1 kilometre equals 0.62137 miles.  \n",
    "    Miles = kilometre * 0.62137  \n",
    "    And,  \n",
    "    Kilometre = Miles / 0.62137\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Hence, the value \"0.62137\" would be considered as the factor of conversation or the ratio for converting units.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Steps to be Followed for Converting Kilometre unit to Miles Unit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We follow the below steps for getting a clear idea of how to convert kilometres to miles units.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 1: We will define the variable for storing the value of kilometre_1 and accepting the input from the user.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        kilometre_1 = float (input (\"Please enter the speed of car in Kilometre as a unit: \"))  \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Step 2: Now, we will define and store the conversion factor into the variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "       conversion_ratio_1 = 0.621371\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Step 3: Then, we will define the variable for storing the value of kilometre_1 which is converted into miles. \n",
    "    Then in addition we will write the logic of converting kilometre to miles units.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      miles_1 = kilometre_1 * conversion_ratio_1  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Step 4: At last, we will display the converted value by using the print() function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        print (\"The speed value of car in Miles: \", miles_1)  \n",
    "        \n",
    "    Full Extension of Code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    kilometre_1 = float (input (\"Please enter the speed of car in Kilometre as a unit: \"))  \n",
    "    conversion_ratio_1 = 0.621371  \n",
    "    miles_1 = kilometre_1 * conversion_ratio_1  \n",
    "    print (\"The speed value of car in Miles: \", miles_1) \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Please enter the speed of car in Kilometre as a unit:  16\n",
    "    The speed value of car in Miles:  9.941936\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Approach 2:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We can also use another approach of simply statistically defining a function for converting kilometres to miles unit.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        def kilometre_1(km):  \n",
    "        conversion_ratio_1= 0.621371  \n",
    "        miles_1 = km * conversion_ratio_1  \n",
    "        print (\"The speed value of car in Miles: \", miles_1)  \n",
    "    km = float (input (\"Please enter the speed of car in Kilometre as a unit: \"))  \n",
